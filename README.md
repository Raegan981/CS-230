# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to be web-based and support multiple platforms. Draw It or Lose It is based on the 1980s game show Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The web-based software instead uses a library of stock drawings as clues that are rendered at a steady rate within 30-seconds as teams take their turns. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did particularly well on the Domain Model and Recommendations sections. I worked to explain the relationships and highlight the implementation of OOP principles within the domain model. Furthermore, the recommendations section clearly outlines specific platform, architecture, storage/memory, distributed systems, and security suggestions while summarizing information gained throughout the course. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was helpful to break down the process of development while working through the design document. For example, summarizing the software requirements and constraints ensured that expectations were well-defined before beginning development. Furthermore, describing the Domain Model helps to understand the software relationships as well as visualize the system. Not only this, but the evaluation also helped greatly when anaylzing the optimal platform, architecture, etc. for Draw It or Lose It. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Evaluation section by going more in-depth on the client side to better explain the advantages and disadvantages of each platform.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are an essential aspect of software design as they determine the function of the software. For example, a fundamental part of software design is creating solutions to a problem or bringing an idea to fruition. Without an understanding of the user's needs, the overall purpose of the design cannot be defined. This leads to disorganization, miscommunication, and other issues in development that lead to an unsatisfactory product. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Utilizing a design document is a strategy I would use in the future as it is extremely beneficial in staying organized and gathering necessary information to make informed decisions throughout the design process.
